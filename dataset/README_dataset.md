# Data preprocessing

The file **Extract_Africa.ipynb** was used to extract Africa from World wide shapefile and csv data.

As a result, Africa data were selected form the **covid_19_data.csv** file containing the Covid worldwide statistics into the **covid_africa.csv** file. 
The African countries were also clipped from the **99bfd9e7-bb42-4728-87b5-07f8c8ac631c2020328-1-1vef4ev.lu5nk** shapefiles containing world countries into the **africa** shapefile.

# Mapping in html

The file **covid_project.ipynb** was used to merge shapefile and csv data into a commun file and to generate the interactive map in html format.
